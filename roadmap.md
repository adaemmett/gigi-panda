Roadmap

# Project name: Network Analysis of OA infrastructure Projects

## Main problem: 

understanding the landscape of successful projects, gaps in coverage in regions, strengths in the network, & vulnerabilities

## Benefits: 

Knowing where future infrastructure can be strengthened; where new nodes are needed, where overlap already exists.


**Milestones**
1. who will help analyze? Find a network analysis expert to manage data once it is gathered and run analysis.
2. identify metadata needed for network analysis: what data do I need to get the most meaningful network/project description without taxing contributors of the data (survey)
3. partners to get contributors to the survey; need the data to come in.

4. This is frequently a link to a document we call the CONTRIBUTING file.  Weâ€™ll be talking about that briefly this afternoon in the GitHub session.
Contributors can help define the metadata needed, the expertise to do complex network analysis; contribute data about the OA projects/infrastructure.
