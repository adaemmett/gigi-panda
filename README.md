## Welcome to our Network Analysis of OA infrastructure Project Repository 2017

**What is this Network Analysis of OA Infrastructure Project?**

Summary: a need to understand the landscape of successful collective-funding and cooperatively organized projects related to open access infrastructure generally build and/or operated by a non-profit collective of organizations, in order to note the qualities, the interconnections, strengths, of those open access projects (think, Open Library of the Humanities; Knowledge Unlatched; Directory of Open Access Journals; arXive; and many others) and the gaps in coverage in regions, strengths in the network, & vulnerabilities

**Who are we?**

We are a group of researchers and faculty at the University of Kansas, who have been working in the area of openness and the future of open access publishing. We are convinced that for a healthy equitable and sustainable open access publishing system cooperative projects, large-scale and small must be developed with partners from around the world, not simply power-players in the global north and west. We are also convinced that to meet those requirements of equity the system must be deployed to serve the public good and be community controlled.

**Who do we need?**

We are looking for contributors to parnter with us at various stages:
1. shaping the data we will collect in order to do a useful analysis and build a useful network analysis; 
2. contributers to suggest individuals, organizations, entities to help share the data collection instrument; 
3. contributors to provide the data; and 
4. network analysis experts to help analyze the data.

**Stages** assemble partners; select data fields to collect and later assess; survey to collect the data; analyze the data; develop network analysis. 

**Benefits**
Knowing where future infrastructure can be strengthened; where new nodes are needed, where overlap already exists.

**In depth desription, purpose, need**

The open access community needs to assemble a comprehensive and synthetic global mapping and analysis of the projects (particularly collective funding/action projects), initiatives, associations, coalitions, and organizations, whether run by scholars, institutions, funders, states, or nations, that are working in these key areas, addressing the themes mentioned above. A crowd-sourced data collection followed by a network analysis and inventory of the entire suite of initiatives towards building an openn access (OA) publishing system would be developed. This analysis will illustrate and illuminate how different organizations and initiatives relate to one another, and where power structures, and local/regional/international projects are and how they overlap. This analysis will help the OA community to identify zones of convergence, areas of affinity among interests and initiatives, and nodes where collaboration does not exist but could easily be built, just as these techniques have illuminated connections and linkages between elements in biological communities and ecosystems (Dormann, 2017). Network analyses initiate from data linking different elements--in this case of OA initiatives. An example might be an initiative that connects scholars and platinum OA publishing venues, or another that links OA repositories with efficient search and discovery mechanisms; network analysis assesses the connectivity or isolation of all actors in a system and creates a network. Within the network, it is then possible to identify redundancies (i.e., initiatives that could profitably coordinate or link or merge) versus fragile linkages that might need to be bolstered or built. This mapping can guide the OA community to understand the landscape, and identify natural opportunities for collaboration and experimentation. Such a mapping will also offer test beds for agile or iterative design processes, short cycles of assessment, reflection, and action, for projects and larger coalitions of projects to advance together. We will seek partners and funding for this mapping in the months to come.
