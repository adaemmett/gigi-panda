test for OA network analysis
:panda_face:

##Project title: Network Analysis of OA infrastructure Projects##

**Project description**

Main problem: understanding the landscape of successful projects, gaps in coverage in regions, strengths in the network, & vulnerabilities
Benefits: Knowing where future infrastructure can be strengthened; where new nodes are needed, where overlap already exists.


**Milestones**
1. who will help analyze? Find a network analysis expert to manage data once it is gathered and run analysis.
2. identify metadata needed for network analysis: what data do I need to get the most meaningful network/project description without taxing contributors of the data (survey)
3. partners to get contributors to the survey; need the data to come in.
